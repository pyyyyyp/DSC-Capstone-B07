# DSC-Capstone-B07

## Description
Welcome to the DSC180A Capstone Project: Graph ML for Chip Profiling. This repository showcases our learning through three distinct assignments. 

- **Assignment 1:** Focuses on the basics of graph theory, where we create a graph of our choice.
- **Assignment 2:** Designed to build our intuition and understanding of chip data, laying the foundation for our quarter two project.
- **Assignment 3:** Concentrates on creating a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model from scratch. We utilize data for training and testing, experimenting with different layout layers and training sizes to observe the results.


## Retrieving the data locally
To access the data required for Assignment 3, please download it using the following link: [Data Download Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Scq35gvCQvIMrmthGs7MUhc8c1VZ8ZwN/view)


## Running the Project
1. For a streamlined environment setup, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` in the root directory.
2. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in each assignment folder.
3. Download data for Assignment 3, unzip the file, and place it in the same directory as Assignment 3.
4. Each assignment folder contains an IPython notebook (ipynb) with preloaded imports, data retrieval from the current directory, and code to produce the answers. 

Feel free to explore each assignment's respective folders for detailed instructions, code, and insights gained during our exploration in the realm of Graph Machine Learning for Chip Profiling.

Thank you for visiting our repository!
